# Example secrets file for local testing with act
# Copy this to .secrets and fill in your values (or use dummy values for replay mode)
# 
# Note: For test-suite in replay mode, dummy values are fine since no real API calls are made

VERTEX_API_KEY=dummy-key-for-replay-mode

# If you want to test with real API keys (not recommended for CI testing):
# VERTEX_API_KEY=your-real-vertex-api-key
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-real-google-api-key
